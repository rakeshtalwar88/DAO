### The Assignment

Install Ansible Tower on your controller machine using the [latest installer](http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz) and upload your license file. 

1. Follow the [quick installation instructions](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/index.html) to configure and run the single integrated installation of Ansible Tower on the control machine.
2. Sign into the Ansible Tower UI and upload the license file to enable the instance when promted. Request a trial license if one hasn't been provided already. (Either trial license type will suffice for these lab assignments.)
