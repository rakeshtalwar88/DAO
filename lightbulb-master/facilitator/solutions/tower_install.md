# Workshop: Installing Tower

Here students are tasked with installing and activating a new single integrated instance of Ansible Tower. The assignment will show students how they can run an instance of Tower themselves for testing, demos and their own proof-of-concepts. 

#### Tips

If you are working in an environment that does not have access repos such as EPEL, you can opt to use the [Ansible Tower bundle installer](http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup-bundle/ansible-tower-setup-bundle-latest.el7.tar.gz) instead. This bundle includes all of the RPMs from these repositories. It does not include **all** of the RPMs required.

Once downloaded, configured and the `setup.sh` is started, is will take a few minutes to install all of the Ansible Tower dependencies. Students can take a short break while that runs.

### Solution

1. Retreive the latest version of Tower from the Ansible Tower releases archive.  
2. Unarchive the retreived Ansible Tower archive.
    * i.e. `tar -vxzf towerlatest` 
3. Change directories to the one created by the expanded Tower software archive.
4. Edit the `inventory` file with passwords for admin, message queue and the postgres database will use while setting up. These are represented by these inventory variables:
    * `admin_password` 
    * `rabbitmq_password`
    * `pg_password`
5. Run the setup.sh script with sudo.
6. Verify Ansible has been successfully installed and started, load the Ansible Tower UI in a web browser using the control machine IP address. 
7. Sign in as the admin user with the password created in the installation process. You will be prompted for a license.
8. Request a trial license if one hasn't been provided already. (Either trial license type will suffice.)
9. Import/upload the license file.
10. Extra Credit: Open the ping API end point in a web browser -- the URL will be something like like https://tower.host.ip/v1/api/ping.

These are the approximate BASH commands to do this:

```bash
$ wget https://bit.ly/towerlatest
$ tar -xzvf towerlatest
$ cd ansible-tower-setup-x.x.x
$ vi inventory
# (make edits to inventory variables like in step 4)
$ sudo ./setup.sh
```

NOTE: If you don't have access to EPEL you can use https://bit.ly/towerbundlelatest.

Once completed switch to your browser to sign into the Ansible Tower UI as admin and setup the instance with a license file.
