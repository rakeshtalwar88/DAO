# Workshop: Basic Playbook

Here students are tasked with developing their first complete playbook. The assignment approximates the tasks they will typical need to take in order to deploy and configure a single application service using Nginx.

The "simple" lightbulb examples, students may or may not have done depending on agenda, provide a quick introduction to playbook structure to give them a feel for how Ansible works, but in practice are too simplistic to be useful. 

#### Tips

Don't rush this workshop. Give students ample time to do this workshop themselves to completion. This workshop covers the essential concepts and features of effectively automation with Ansible and builds up their core skills for further exploration. 

### Solution

The solution to this workshop is `nginx-basic-playbook` under `examples/`. 

The `nginx-basic-playbook` example also includes the first extra credit assignment via the last task using the `uri` module. We intentionally only check that the web server is responding with the home page we generated by searching for the value of `nginx_test_message`. We are not checking if the server is accessible to outside world in keeping things basic.

The solution to the second extra credit assignment is `nginx-remove-playbook` under `examples/`.
